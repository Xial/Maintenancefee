# Maintenance Fee
This Cities: Skylines mod allows for _setting the in-game maintenance fees_.

This update includes compatibility with the Parklife expansion and its Sightseeing Tours buses. It does not yet include content for Industries (because I can't find the damn hooks, haha).

Once installed, the menu may be accessed by pressing `Escape` and choosing _Game Options_, then locating _Maintenance Fee_ in the list.
